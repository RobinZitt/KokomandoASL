# Kokomando Autosplitter
## Features
- Automatically starts the timer when entering the first level
- Automatically splits when finishing a level except for the last level
- Automatically splits when the last cutscene starts (on time). More in the "Last Split" section
- Automatically stops the timer (game time) on the loading screen
## Last Split
Currently the autosplitter counts the cutscenes in the last level and splits on the beginning of the second cutscene. This counter can be changed to the first or third cutscene in the settings, if you can skip the first cutscene (There is currently no (efficient) way to do that) or you want to activate an additional cutscene. I will try to change that in the future, so the split works independently from the amount of cutscenes you activate.
